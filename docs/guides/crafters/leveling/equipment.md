# Equipment

The following collection of equipment sets aren't intended to represent the best possible equipment at a given level. Instead, these are the equipment sets that are used for the collectable crafting rotations provided later in this guide.

These equipment sets are meant to take advantage of alternative currencies that you most likely have mountains of already, such as Grand Company Seals. Importantly, I've tried to keep the gil cost as low as possible.

:::tip
As you turn in collectables, you'll be "paid" in experience and White Crafters' Scrips. Save these, as these will be used to buy equipment upgrades as you go!

You will almost certainly earn more scrips than you can spend; consider spending these on equipment for the other crafting jobs you plan to level, so that by the time you need it on those other jobs, you already have it.

The Red Coral/Electrum accessories can be purchased from Seghuie in Ishgard, located in The Pillars, X: 7.4, Y: 10.3.
:::

:::tip
If you don't have any White Crafters' Scrips (yet), pick up the Mythril secondary tool (ilvl 43) instead. You can buy it from any normal tradecraft tool vendor in the major cities for 4394 gil.

The macros for level 50 and 52 collectables have been written to reach maximum collectability in both cases without breaking if you use the higher one.

:::danger
The Ironworks set (armor and accessories) is usable by all crafting jobs, but it's a crafted set and therefore _far more expensive_ than the Keep's/Handmaster's Sets, and for worse stats.

**I do not recommend going this route due to the cost.**

You'll farm enough White Crafters' Scrips in the course of following this guide to get the Keep's equipment for every other crafting job by the time you hit 90 on the first one.
:::

:::danger
No matter which armor set you go with, there is absolutely _no reason_ to ever use the Ironworks accessories. For a universal set at level 60, get the Ironworks Armor and the Handmaster's Accessories.
:::

:::info
In either case, use the primary and secondary tools from the Keep's set.

#### Notes

This is a very solid option that will let you craft most things with excellent results.

Without buffs or melding, it will fall short of the craftsmanship and/or control requirements of the 90☆☆☆☆ recipes.

With careful melding (see below), food, and tinctures, you'll be able to craft even the 90☆☆☆☆ recipes, though you probably won't be able to reach 100% HQ on the precrafts (35 durability). You can get close, around 90%, but that means you'll wind up with NQ precrafts some of the time. You will be able to reliably reach 100% HQ on the 90☆☆☆☆ final craft recipes (70 durability) if you use all HQ precraft materials.

I was able to craft Diadochos gear and its precrafts with the above equipment, the following materia, Jhinga Biryani (HQ), and a Competent Craftsman's Draught:

| Item | Materia |
| :-: | :-: |
| Afflatus Primary Tool | Craftsman's Competence Materia X (Craftsmanship +27) |
| Afflatus Secondary Tool | Craftsman's Competence Materia X (Craftsmanship +27) |
| Artful Afflatus Work Cap | Craftsman's Competence Materia X (Craftsmanship +27)<br />Craftsman's Competence Materia X (Craftsmanship +27) |
| Artful Afflatus Work Shirt | Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18)<br />Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18) |
| Artful Afflatus Halfgloves | Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18)<br />Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18) |
| Artful Afflatus Hose | Craftsman's Cunning Materia X (CP +10)<br />Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18) |
| Artful Afflatus Workboots | Craftsman's Cunning Materia X (CP +10)<br />Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18) |
| Artful Afflatus Earrings | Craftsman's Cunning Materia X (CP +10) |
| Artful Afflatus Necklace | Craftsman's Cunning Materia X (CP +10) |
| Artful Afflatus Bracelet | Craftsman's Cunning Materia X (CP +10) |
| Artful Afflatus Ring | Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18) |
| Artful Afflatus Ring | Craftsman's Command Materia X (Control +18) |

The Afflatus equipment **cannot** be overmelded. They're limited to only the normal materia slots: two for worn items, one for tools or accessories.

:::caution
Overmelding is **expensive**. Read the notes for the BiS set below.
:::

### Level 90 (6.4/6.5 BiS)

The excellent folks over at Teamcraft have [crunched the numbers](https://guides.ffxivteamcraft.com/guide/crafting-melding-guide#recommended-set-6-4) for you already. 

:::danger
As I said previously, overmelding is expensive. You can expect to burn through millions of gil in the process, and only the gods can even begin to guess as to how many millions we're talking about.

Be absolutely certain that you need the stats that this provides before going this route. If you choose to proceed, welcome to the dysfunctional family of crafter mains, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
